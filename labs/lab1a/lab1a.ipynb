    "## Question 4 â€“ Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) isn't a programming language â€“ it's a \"markup language\", which means that it is designed to format text to look nice. But like a programming language, Markdown has a set of rules (syntax) that govern how it works. Think of it like a fancy Google Docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the most important rules in Markdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Double asterisks (`**`) are how we make words bold. `My name is **Billy**` renders to \"My name is **Billy**.\n",
    "- Underscores (`_`) are how we make words italicized. `How are _you_?` renders to How are _you_?, and `what is **_up_**` renders to what is **_up_**.\n",
    "- Hashtags (`#`, `##`, `###`) are how we create titles/headings. The more hashtags you include, the smaller the title is. The title for this question was generated using `## Question 5 â€“ Markdown`.\n",
    "- Unbulleted and bulleted lists are created the same way they're created in a standard word processor, like Google Docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is important to learn because Jupyter Notebooks are often full of Markdown cells (just like this lab). We use them frequently to explain our work to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to recreate the output in the following screenshot, using the Markdown cell below. Feel free to replace \"Taco Stand\" and \"country\" with your own favorite food and music genre, and feel free to change the image to any other image that is publicly available on the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src='images/ex.png' width=65%></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "***Hint:*** First, figure out how to recreate everything other than the image. The syntax for Markdown can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). This page also contains information on how to embed images, but you'll find that in default Markdown there's no way to control the size of the image that appears. To specify the width (or height) of the image you're embedding, you'll need to use HTML instead; see [this page](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp) for more details (you can put HTML directly in a Markdown cell). If you want to embed the exact same image as us, use [this link](https://ucsdtritons.com/images/2011/3/16/CRIGMQCZAINDDIB.20110316235149.jpg).\n",
